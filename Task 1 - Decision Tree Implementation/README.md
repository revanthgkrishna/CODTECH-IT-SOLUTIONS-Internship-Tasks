Description:

The objective of this task is to implement a Decision Tree model using Scikit-learn to classify or predict outcomes on a chosen dataset. Decision Trees are a fundamental supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression tasks. The task involves loading a dataset, preprocessing the data, training a Decision Tree model, visualizing the tree structure, and evaluating its performance. The visualization will help in understanding how the tree splits the data and makes decisions. 


Steps :

Load and explore the dataset.
Preprocess the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a Decision Tree model using Scikit-learn.
Visualize the Decision Tree.
Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance using metrics like confusion matrix and classification report.
